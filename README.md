<b>Tuberculosis Classification and Detection with Visual Transformer and YOLOv5</b>

This repository demonstrates a comprehensive implementation of Tuberculosis classification and detection using state-of-the-art techniques: Visual Transformer for classification and YOLOv5 for detection. The repository includes code, dataset, and results, providing a complete solution for Tuberculosis detection and classification tasks.

<b>Dataset: TBX11K-Simplified from Kaggle</b>

The dataset used in this project is TBX11K-Simplified, collected from Kaggle. It consists of diverse chest X-ray images expertly annotated for Tuberculosis lesions and lung abnormalities. The dataset is obtained from multiple healthcare institutions, ensuring diverse patient demographics and X-ray quality.

<b>Data Preprocessing</b>

We meticulously preprocessed the dataset to ensure uniformity, standardization, and appropriate formatting. Annotations were converted to the YOLOv5 compatible format for seamless integration.

<b>Visual Transformer for Classification</b>

Leveraging the powerful Visual Transformer, a state-of-the-art deep learning architecture for image classification, we fine-tuned the model on TBX11K-Simplified to accurately predict Tuberculosis presence.

<b>YOLOv5 for Detection</b>

For detection, we employed YOLOv5, an efficient object detection framework known for its real-time performance. The model was trained on annotated TBX11K-Simplified to localize and classify TB lesions.

<b>Results and Performance Metrics</b>

The repository presents results from the Visual Transformer classification model and YOLOv5 detection model. Comprehensive evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, assess model performance on TBX11K-Simplified.

<b>Contribution</b>

The code and implementation are solely authored by me, and we contribute this solution to the open-source community. We hope it inspires advancements in Tuberculosis detection and improves healthcare outcomes.
